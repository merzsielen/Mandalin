# Language in *Mandalin*
## Overview
 *Mandalin* features languages and language families which play
 a part in the development of certain ethnic, religious, and
 political identities.

## Resources
 I intend here to gather some resources which will determine how
 we go about coding things like language change (which will at
 most be a vague approximation based on abstract phonologies,
 morphologies, orthographies, etc). *Mandalin* will only track a
 few general features of languages such as their general head-
 directionality; whether they are agglutinative, fusional,
 isolating, etc; the size of their consonant and vowel
 inventories; and whether they feature certain broad features
 such as vowel or consonant harmony, ergativity, and topic-
 prominence.
