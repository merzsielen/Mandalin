# Outline for *Mandalin*
## Introduction
 Mandalin is a sort of blend of 4X and grand strategy games
 with a strong emphasis on simulation which aims to provide
 personal yet sweeping narratives about history, language,
 culture, and economics. It takes place on a hex-based grid
 tiled over a spherical world with randomly generated continents,
 biomes, and various features which inform the evolution of
 peoples and cultures across the globe.
